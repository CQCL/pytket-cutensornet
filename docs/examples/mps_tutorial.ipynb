Each bond allows a different number of values for its indices; for instance `0 <= i < 4` would mean that the first bond of our tensor can take up to four different indices; we refer to this as the *dimension* of the bond. We refer to the bonds connecting different tensors in the MPS as *virtual bonds*; the maximum allowed value for the dimension of virtual bonds is often denoted by the greek letter `chi`. The open bonds are known as *physical bonds* and, in our case, each will correspond to a qubit; hence, they have dimension `2` -- the dimension of the vector space of a single qubit.<br>\n", "In essence, whenever we want to apply a gate to certain qubit we will connect a tensor (matrix) representing the gate to the corresponding physical bond and *contract* the network back to an MPS form (tensor contraction is a generalisation of matrix multiplication to multidimensional arrays). Whenever a two-qubit gate is applied, the entanglement information after contraction will be kept in the degrees of freedom of the virtual bonds. As such, the dimension of the virtual bonds will generally increase exponentially as we apply entangling gates, leading to large memory footprints of the tensors and, consequently, long runtime for tensor contraction. We provide functionalities to limit the growth of the dimension of the virtual bonds, keeping resource consumption in check.

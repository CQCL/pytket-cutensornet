pytket-cutensornet
==================

`cuTensorNet <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/cutensornet/index.html>`_ is a
high-performance library for tensor network computations, developed by NVIDIA.
It is part of the `cuQuantum <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/index.html>`_ SDK -
a high-performance library aimed at quantum circuit simulations on the NVIDIA GPU chips,
consisting of two major components:

* ``cuStateVec``: a high-performance library for state vector computations.
* ``cuTensorNet``: a high-performance library for tensor network computations.

Both components have both C and Python API.

``pytket-cutensornet`` is an extension to ``pytket`` that allows ``pytket`` circuits and
expectation values to be simulated using ``cuTensorNet`` via an interface to
`cuQuantum Python <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/python/index.html>`_.

``pytket-cutensornet`` is available for Python 3.9 and 3.10, on Linux, MacOS and
Windows. In order to use it, you need access to a GPU machine and first install
``cuQuantum Python`` following their installation
`instructions  <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/python/README.html#installation>`_.
This will include the necessary dependencies such as CUDA toolkit. Then, to install
``pytket-cutensornet``, run:

::

   pip install pytket-cutensornet

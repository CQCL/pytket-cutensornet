pytket-cutensornet
==================

``pytket-cutensornet`` is an extension to ``pytket`` that allows ``pytket`` circuits and
expectation values to be simulated using `cuTensorNet <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html>`_.

`cuTensorNet <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html>`_ is a
high-performance library for tensor network computations, developed by NVIDIA.
It is part of the `cuQuantum <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/index.html>`_ SDK --
a high-performance library aimed at quantum circuit simulations on the NVIDIA GPU chips.

We provide two core functionalities:

* *Full tensor network contraction*: use ``tk_to_tensor_network`` to translate a ``pytket`` circuit to a ``TensorNetwork`` and obtain expectation values and amplitudes via full tensor network contraction using ``cuQuantum``'s optimised contraction path.

* *Matrix Product State (MPS)*: use ``simulate`` to simulate a ``pytket`` circuit, returning an ``MPS`` representation of the output state, of which you can then ``get_amplitude`` or calculate inner products with other MPS via ``vdot``.

Currently, only single-GPU calculations are supported, but a multi-GPU execution will be
implemented in the due course using ``mpi4py`` library.

``pytket-cutensornet`` is available for Python 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 on Linux.
In order to use it, you need access to a Linux machine with an NVIDIA GPU of Compute Capability +7.0 (check it `here <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>`_) and first install ``cuQuantum Python`` following their installation
`instructions  <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/python/README.html#installation>`_.
This will include the necessary dependencies such as CUDA toolkit. Then, to install
``pytket-cutensornet``, run:

::

   pip install pytket-cutensornet

        """Instantiate a configuration object for ``StructuredState`` simulation.

        Note:
            Providing both a custom ``chi`` and ``truncation_fidelity`` will raise an
            exception. Choose one or the other (or neither, for exact simulation).

        Args:
            chi: The maximum value allowed for the dimension of the virtual
                bonds. Higher implies better approximation but more
                computational resources. If not provided, ``chi`` will be unbounded.
            truncation_fidelity: Every time a two-qubit gate is applied, the virtual
                bond will be truncated to the minimum dimension that satisfies
                ``|<psi|phi>|^2 >= trucantion_fidelity``, where ``|psi>`` and ``|phi>``
                are the states before and after truncation (both normalised).
                If not provided, it will default to its maximum value 1.
            seed: Seed for the random number generator. Setting a seed provides
                reproducibility across simulations using ``StructuredState``, in the
                sense that they will produce the same sequence of measurement outcomes.
                Crucially, consecutive samples taken from the same ``StructuredState``
                can still be different from each other.
            float_precision: The floating point precision used in tensor calculations;
                choose from ``numpy`` types: ``np.float64`` or ``np.float32``.
                Complex numbers are represented using two of such
                ``float`` numbers. Default is ``np.float64``.
            value_of_zero: Any number below this value will be considered equal to zero.
                Even when no ``chi`` or ``truncation_fidelity`` is provided, singular
                values below this number will be truncated.
                We suggest to use a value slightly below what your chosen
                ``float_precision`` can reasonably achieve. For instance, ``1e-16`` for
                ``np.float64`` precision (default) and ``1e-7`` for ``np.float32``.
            leaf_size: For ``TTN`` simulation only. Sets the maximum number of
                qubits in a leaf node when using ``TTN``. Default is 8.
            k: For ``MPSxMPO`` simulation only. Sets the maximum number of layers
                the MPO is allowed to have before being contracted. Increasing this
                might increase fidelity, but it will also increase resource requirements
                exponentially. Default value is 4.
            optim_delta: For ``MPSxMPO`` simulation only. Sets the stopping criteria for
                the optimisation when contracting the ``k`` layers of MPO. Stops when
                the increase of fidelity between iterations is smaller than this value.
                Default value is ``1e-5``.
            loglevel: Internal logger output level. Use 30 for warnings only, 20 for
                verbose and 10 for debug mode.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If both ``chi`` and ``truncation_fidelity`` are fixed.

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides examples of the usage of the TTN functionalities of `pytket_cutensornet`. For more information, see the docs at https://tket.quantinuum.com/extensions/pytket-cutensornet/api/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some good references to learn about Tree Tensor Network state simulation:\n",
    "- For an introduction into TTN based simulation of quantum circuits: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01000\n",
    "- For an introduction on some of the optimisation concerns that are relevant to TTN: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03196\n",
    "The implementation in pytket-cutensornet differs from previously published literature. I am still experimenting with the algorithm. I intend to write up a document detailing the approach, once I reach a stable version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of TTN over MPS is that it can be used to efficiently simulate circuits with richer qubit connectivity. This does **not** mean that TTN has an easy time simulating all-to-all connectivity, but it is far more flexible than MPS. TTN's strength is in simulating circuit where certain subsets of qubits interact densely with each other, and there is not that many gates acting on qubits in different subsets."

    "# How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface for TTN matches that of MPS. As such, you should be able to run any code that uses `SimulationAlgorithm.MPSxGate` by replacing it with `SimulationAlgorithm.TTNxGate`. Calling `prepare_circuit_mps` is no longer necessary, since `TTNxGate` can apply gates between non-neighbouring qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: If you are new to pytket-cutensornet, it is highly recommended to start reading the `mps_tutorial.ipynb` notebook instead. More details about the use of the library are discussed there (for instance, why and when to call `CuTensorNetHandle()`)."
